# SmartBuizBuddy – Trading Bot for Price Action Scalping

A Python-based trading assistant designed to help short-term traders identify real-time buy and sell signals using simple price action logic and technical indicators.

## Why This Project
I wanted to explore how automated trading strategies can reduce decision fatigue and support faster, data-driven trades. I also wanted to help create a path toward financial independence for myself and my family, especially with the uncertainty of today’s job market. This project represents the beginning of my journey into algorithmic finance and backend automation.
